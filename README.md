# DiceGame
Simple dice game using JavaScritp, HTML and CSS

GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to their ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all their ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn

Some rules added later on:
- The player can set the winning score by entering a number in a textbox. If the winning score is not set, the first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
- A new dice added to the game. Now, a player looses their current score when one of the dices is =0.
